The provided code snippet showcases the creation of a virtual machine (VM) in Azure using Azure PowerShell. Let's break it down step by step:

**1. Connect to Azure:**

- `Connect-AzAccount`: This line establishes a connection between your local machine and your Azure subscription using Azure PowerShell.

**2. Create a Resource Group:**

- `New-AzResourceGroup`: This line creates a resource group named "TutorialResources" in the "Central US" location. Resource groups act as containers to organize your Azure resources like VMs, virtual networks, etc.

**3. Get VM Credentials:**

- `$cred = Get-Credential`: This line prompts you to enter a username and password for the administrator account that will be used to access the VM after creation.

**4. Define VM Parameters:**

- A variable named `$vmParams` is created using a hashtable (indicated by `@{}`). This hashtable stores all the essential details needed to configure the VM. Here's a breakdown of the parameters:
    - `ResourceGroupName`: Set to "TutorialResources", referencing the previously created group.
    - `Name`: Sets the VM name to "TutorialVM1".
    - `Location`: Specifies the location as "eastus" (East US).
    - `ImageName`: Defines the desired OS image, here it's "Win2016Datacenter" (Windows Server 2016 Datacenter).
    - `PublicIpAddressName`: Assigns a public IP address name, "tutorialPublicIp", for remote access.
    - `Credential`: Stores the administrator credentials obtained in step 3.
    - `OpenPorts`: Opens port 3389 (remote desktop) for accessing the VM.
    - `Size`: Sets the VM size to "Standard_D2s_v3", which defines computing resources like CPU and memory.

**5. Create the Virtual Machine:**

- `$newVM1 = New-AzVM @vmParams`: This line executes the `New-AzVM` cmdlet with the parameters stored in `$vmParams`. This creates the virtual machine "TutorialVM1" based on the specified configuration.

**6. Note:**

- The comment section refers to the online documentation for the specific code block used in this example. 

By running this script, you'll be deploying a Windows Server 2016 Datacenter virtual machine named "TutorialVM1" with remote desktop access enabled in the "eastus" Azure region. Remember to replace placeholders like usernames and passwords with your desired values.
